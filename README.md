# rabbit r1 source code [part 1]

[rabbit.tech](rabbit.tech) has been making waves with its highly publicized release of the Rabbit R1 device, claiming it can perform tasks on your behalf and liberate you from app-based interactions. But let's call a spade a spade – **this is a blatant lie**. And we're about to expose it with the first partial release of the source code for its so-called "large action model".

For those with a technical background, it's painfully clear that there's **no artificial intelligence or large action model in sight**. In reality, they're simply relying on several **Playwright** automation scripts to do the job for you, which is why they only support four apps: Spotify, Midjourney, Doordash, and UberEats.
 
What's even more alarming is that they ask you to login through their web portal, which is just a virtual machine connected via **NoVNC**. They also expect you to **fill in your private passwords on their VMs**. To make matters worse, they **store the user sessions on their machines** without any additional layers of security. This is both a blatant disregard for user privacy and a hilariously bad engineering practice.
 
Sadly, this shouldn't come as a shock to anyone who's done minimal due diligence on the team. After all, they were still hawking NFTs just two years ago. 

Spread the word and stay vigilant.
